# Recursion and Backtracking
Welcome to the Recursion and Backtracking repository! This repository is dedicated to understanding and implementing recursive algorithms and backtracking techniques. Here, you'll find a collection of examples, resources, and discussions related to these powerful problem-solving approaches.

# What is Recursion and Backtracking?
Recursion is a programming technique where a function calls itself to solve a problem by breaking it down into smaller, similar subproblems. It allows for elegant and concise solutions to complex problems that exhibit a recursive structure.
#
Backtracking, on the other hand, is a systematic way of exploring all possible solutions by incrementally building a solution candidate and intelligently pruning the search space when it becomes clear that it cannot lead to a valid solution. Backtracking is often used in conjunction with recursion to efficiently solve problems that involve finding combinations, permutations, or satisfying certain constraints.
#
Both recursion and backtracking are fundamental techniques used in various fields, including computer science, mathematics, and artificial intelligence.
